# COVID-19 Data Analysis in Indonesia
## Project Description
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data in Indonesia to understand the trends and patterns of the spread, as well as to evaluate its impact at the regional level. The data used in this analysis comes from a time series dataset related to COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, including data on new cases, deaths, recoveries, and geographical details.
## Objectives
- Understand the trend of COVID-19 cases over time.
- Determine the geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia.
- Analyze the growth factor for new cases and deaths.
- Discover insights from the data that can aid in decision-making regarding pandemic management.
## Analysis Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an initial analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the data, including examining the number of columns, data types, descriptive statistics, and patterns of missing values. Simple visualizations like histograms and line plots are used to examine the distribution and trends in the data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning and transformation, including removing irrelevant columns, filling in missing values with appropriate methods, and converting data types as necessary.
3. Visualization Analysis: Use data visualizations to understand the trends and patterns in the dataset. Some examples of visualizations performed include:
- Line plots to show the trend of new cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
- Visualizing the distribution of cases based on geographical regions.
- Total cases in each province.
4. Insight Analysis: From the results of the visualizations and analysis, some insights found include:
- There is a significant increase in new cases and deaths during certain periods.
- Some regions have faster growth rates of cases than others.
- The growth factor can help identify trends in the increase or decrease of cases.
## Conclusion
This project provides insights into the trends and patterns of COVID-19 spread in Indonesia. The analysis conducted can serve as a basis for understanding the development of the pandemic and provide useful information for stakeholders and decision-makers.
